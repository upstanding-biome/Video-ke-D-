# Video-ke Desktop

## Overview ##

> Video-oke is a Karoake application that obtains videos from Youtube.

> Version 3 has integrated Electron for use on the desktop.

> Video-oke was inspiried by picking up the codebase for TRNTBL3000, an app that allowed crossfading across two playlists. Video-oke incorporates this need but adds video functionality and the ability to search the Youtube API to add the songs you want to sing or listen to and use a crossfader in between songs.

## Dependencies ##

> Youtube API v3

> Assert

> JQuery

> Bootstrap

> Express.js
